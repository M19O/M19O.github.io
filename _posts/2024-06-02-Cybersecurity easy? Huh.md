# Is Cybersecurity easy ?

No! Is it hard? Not necessarily. It's up to you to decide. Your approach and way of learning will determine whether cybersecurity feels easy or hard for you. Cybersecurity is all about the mindset of breaking and building, and understanding the foundation of every technology you deal with.

Cybersecurity is neither inherently easy nor hard; its difficulty depends on your approach and mindset. If you adopt a methodical, patient, and inquisitive attitude, you will find it more manageable. Cybersecurity requires a deep understanding of the underlying principles of technology, a willingness to constantly learn, and the ability to think both like a defender and an attacker. It's about the mindset of breaking and building, of seeing how things work, identifying vulnerabilities, and fortifying defenses. Your journey in cybersecurity will be shaped by how you choose to learn, the resources you use, and the passion you bring to the field. With dedication and the right approach, you can navigate the complexities of cybersecurity effectively.

# What are the best roadmaps to pursue a successful career?

There is no single best roadmap to pursue a career in cybersecurity. It's a journey of discovering what works best for you. Different approaches work for different people, and it's important to explore a variety of resources and techniques. You might find value in reading books and blogs, which can provide a strong theoretical foundation and keep you updated on the latest trends. Practical experience is crucial, so consider hacking machines on platforms like Hack The Box or engaging in web app security challenges on PortSwigger and Pentester Lab. Participating in Capture The Flag (CTF) competitions can sharpen your problem-solving skills and give you hands-on experience. Watching instructional videos can also be helpful for visual learners. The key is to stay curious, keep learning, and find the combination of resources and activities that best fit your learning style and career goals.

# How to start then?

Just start learning and stop procrastinating. Begin your journey by understanding the foundations of computer science, then move on to the basics of cybersecurity. Read about the various roles in cybersecurity to see which ones fit your lifestyle. Identify the specific field in cybersecurity that you are passionate about and can commit to studying every single day for the rest of your life. Only you can answer these questions and define your path. no one else can do it for you.

# What is your motivation ? 

The first motivation is putting food on the table. If you think you will always have the same passion and energy, you are mistaken. Success is about consistency and persistence, keep going every day, even if you have a broken arm, a broken leg, or a cold or whatever. Just keep doing what you need to do. 

**Remember**, you don't need to impress everyone or prove anything to anyone. Be happy with your achievements and enjoy the journey.

> **The world ain’t all sunshine and rainbows**. It’s a very mean and nasty place and I don’t care how tough you are it will beat you to your knees and keep you there permanently if you let it. You, me, or nobody is gonna hit as hard as life. **But it ain’t about how hard ya hit. It’s about how hard you can get hit and keep moving forward**.

# How Does the Journey Look?

You will start by learning some things and may think you know everything. Then, as you learn more, you will realize how much you don't know. After this realization, you will continue learning without stopping.

# Imposter syndrome 

Imposter syndrome is something that happens to almost everyone, especially to those who are really good at what they do, like top researchers and hackers. It’s when you feel like you’re not as skilled as others think you are. But it’s normal, and it happens to the best of us.

Take a break and track your progress. Reflect on where you were a year ago and where you are now.


``` Don't stop CHAMP! ```
